# Story 3.6: Implement Drag-and-Drop for Task Cards into Chat

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to drag compliance task cards into chat,
**so that** the AI can help me understand or complete that task.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Task cards (from Kanban Epic 6) made draggable
2. Dragging task card adds context pill
3. Pill displays: task title, "X" to remove
4. Backend includes task metadata: description, linked law, status
5. Example: "How do I complete this task?" → AI explains based on linked law
6. Context persists until removed
7. Visual feedback
8. Mobile: Tap task → "Add to chat context"

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Make task cards draggable
- [ ] Add task context to RAG
- [ ] Test task-related queries

## Dev Notes

**Task Context:**
```typescript
const taskContext = {
  title: "Review GDPR compliance checklist",
  description: "Verify data processing agreements",
  linkedLaw: { id: "law-123", title: "Dataskyddsförordningen" },
  status: "IN_PROGRESS"
}
```

**Reference:** Feature Spec 06 (Kanban)
