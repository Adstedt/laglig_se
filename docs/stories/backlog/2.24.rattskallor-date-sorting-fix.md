# Story 2.24: Fix Rättskällor Date Sorting

## Status

Backlog

## Story

**As a** user browsing the rättskällor catalogue,
**I want** sorting by date to work correctly,
**so that** I can find the most recent or oldest legal documents.

## Problem

The date sorting option on `/rattskallor` is not working as expected. Documents are not being properly ordered when "Datum" sort is selected.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Date sorting (ascending/descending) works correctly on rättskällor page
2. Sort applies to all content types (SFS laws, court cases, EU legislation)
3. Null dates are handled gracefully (sorted to end)
4. Sort persists when paginating through results
5. URL query params reflect current sort state

## Technical Notes

- Check `browseDocuments` action in `app/actions/browse.ts`
- Verify Prisma `orderBy` clause for date fields
- Ensure `effective_date` or `publication_date` is used consistently
- May need to handle null dates with `nulls: 'last'`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Investigate current sorting implementation
- [ ] Fix orderBy clause in browse action
- [ ] Handle null dates appropriately
- [ ] Test with various content types
- [ ] Verify pagination maintains sort order
