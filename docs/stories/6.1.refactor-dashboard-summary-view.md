# Story 6.1: Refactor Dashboard Summary View

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see a dashboard when I log in,
**so that** I get an overview of my compliance status and priorities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Refactor existing dashboard page at `/dashboard` (default landing after login)
2. **Compliance Progress Ring:** Circular progress chart showing % of list items marked "Uppfylld" vs total
3. **Task Summary Cards:**
   - Forfall uppgifter (overdue count, red)
   - Uppgifter denna vecka (due this week)
   - Mina tilldelade uppgifter (assigned to current user)
4. **Recent Activity Feed:**
   - Last 10 actions: "Anna slutforde uppgift X", "Lag Y andrades igar"
   - Timestamp + user avatar
5. **Quick Actions:** Buttons for "Fraga AI", "Lagg till lag", "Bjud in teammedlem"
6. **List Overview:** Top 5 lists with compliance summary per list
7. Mobile-responsive layout (stacked sections on mobile)
8. Dashboard loads in <2 seconds
