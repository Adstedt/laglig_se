# Post-MVP Roadmap (Out of Scope)

The following features are **explicitly NOT included in the MVP** and are planned for post-MVP phases based on user feedback and business traction:

## Phase 2: Integration & Automation (Months 7-9)

**Fortnox OAuth Integration**

- One-click employee sync from Fortnox to Laglig.se
- Automatic schema mapping (FR41 lays foundation)
- **Rationale for deferral:** Requires Fortnox partnership negotiations, OAuth setup, and rigorous data sync testing. MVP validates core value proposition first.

**Slack/Teams Integration**

- Post law changes and AI insights to team channels
- Slash commands for quick AI queries
- **Rationale:** Nice-to-have for team collaboration, not critical for individual user value

## Phase 3: Public Sector Features (Months 10-12)

**Advanced Multi-Department Compliance**

- Department-specific law lists and workflows
- Cross-department audit trails
- Budget tracking for compliance activities
- **Rationale:** Public sector has unique procurement requirements; validate SMB/ISO consultant demand first

**Audit Report Generation**

- Automated compliance reports for auditors
- PDF export with evidence attachments
- **Rationale:** Complex feature requiring deep audit workflow understanding

## Phase 4: Mobile & Expansion (Months 13+)

**Native Mobile Apps**

- iOS and Android native apps
- Offline law access
- Push notifications
- **Rationale:** Web responsive sufficient for MVP; native apps require significant investment

**Multi-Language Support**

- English interface for international companies operating in Sweden
- Norwegian/Danish law databases (expansion)
- **Rationale:** Focus on Swedish market first; internationalization adds complexity

**Advanced Analytics Dashboard**

- Compliance trend analysis
- Team productivity metrics
- Custom reporting
- **Rationale:** Requires significant usage data; build after MVP establishes baseline

## Other Deferred Features

- **Browser Extension:** Quick law lookup from any webpage
- **API for Third-Party Integrations:** Public API for partners
- **White-Label Solution:** For large consultancies to rebrand
- **AI-Powered Compliance Recommendations:** Proactive task generation based on industry changes
- **Video Training Library:** Recorded webinars and tutorials

**Decision Criteria for Adding Features:**

- Feature must serve >30% of active users
- Clear ROI: Revenue impact or significant churn reduction
- Does not distract from core value proposition (law discovery + AI guidance + change monitoring)
