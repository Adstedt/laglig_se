# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

**Primary Business Goals:**

1. **Achieve 10M SEK ARR within 18 months** across three customer segments (SMBs, ISO consultants, public sector) plus Fortnox integration channel

2. **Acquire 760+ paying customers** by Month 18 (260 direct + 500 via Fortnox partnership)

3. **Establish SEO dominance** - Rank #1-3 for 100+ Swedish legal search terms, driving 50,000+ monthly organic visitors

4. **Validate product-market fit** - NPS >50, <5% monthly churn, >40% of customers from referrals/organic/Fortnox channel

5. **Launch Fortnox integration** by Month 9, achieving 500 Fortnox customers and 2.25M SEK ARR by Month 18

**Primary User Goals:**

1. **SMB Owners/HR Managers:** Avoid costly legal mistakes (€10,000-500,000 fines), get quick answers to HR/compliance questions, gain confidence they're "doing it right"

2. **ISO Compliance Managers:** Streamline audit preparation, automate compliance tracking, collaborate with team, stay ahead of regulatory changes

3. **Public Sector Officers:** Centralize compliance across departments, reduce reliance on expensive consultants, maintain audit-ready documentation

**Product Goals:**

1. **Transform compliance from reactive to proactive** - Users discover compliance gaps BEFORE violations occur

2. **Make Swedish law accessible** - 10,000+ laws publicly available with AI-powered plain-language explanations

3. **Provide zero-hallucination legal guidance** - RAG-powered AI that only answers from verified legal sources with full citations

4. **Drive retention through change monitoring** - Automatic notifications when tracked laws change, preventing compliance lapses

5. **Enable "coolt med koll" positioning** - Compliance as aspirational business infrastructure, not burdensome obligation

## Background Context

### The Problem We're Solving

Swedish businesses are legally obligated to comply with hundreds of laws spanning arbetsmiljö (workplace safety), arbetsrätt (employment law), avtalsrätt (contract law), and sector-specific regulations. For most SMBs, compliance is **reactive, expensive, and risky**:

- **Reactive:** Companies only address compliance when facing audits, employee complaints, or violations
- **Expensive when done right:** Legal consultants charge 1,500-3,000 SEK/hour
- **Risky when done wrong:** A single HR mistake can cost 100,000-500,000+ SEK in fines
- **Difficult to navigate:** Existing tools (Notisum, InfoTorg Juridik) have outdated UX, no AI assistance, and require legal expertise

**Market Validation:** Notisum generates ~40M SEK ARR at 60% margins despite inferior product, validating strong demand and healthy unit economics.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

1. **Notisum** - 1990s UX, no AI, just static document access, expensive (8,000+ SEK/year)
2. **Legal consultants** - Expensive, slow, reactive (pay per question)
3. **DIY/Google** - Unreliable, fragmented, high risk of misinterpretation
4. **Enterprise tools** - Overkill for SMBs, require dedicated compliance staff

### Our Approach

Laglig.se transforms legal compliance from a reactive burden into proactive business infrastructure by combining:

1. **Free, SEO-indexed legal content** - All Swedish laws (SFS), court cases, EU regulations publicly accessible
2. **AI-powered compliance tools** (paid) - RAG-based chatbot, personalized law lists, automated task generation, change monitoring
3. **Industry-specific guidance** (paid) - Tailored compliance packs for construction, restaurants, tech, manufacturing

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Freemium SEO Moat:** Public content ranks for everything, drives organic traffic
- **RAG-Powered AI:** Zero-hallucination through comprehensive Swedish law database
- **Proactive, Not Reactive:** Monitors legal changes and pushes tasks BEFORE deadlines
- **Modern UX:** Jira-inspired Kanban, conversational AI, drag-and-drop components
- **"Coolt med koll" Positioning:** Compliance as aspirational, not burdensome

### Strategic Context

This PRD documents the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** scope for Laglig.se, targeting launch within 4-6 months. The MVP focuses on 8 core features that deliver immediate value while establishing the foundation for post-MVP expansion (Fortnox integration, public sector features, advanced collaboration).

The project is **bootstrap-funded** with a **solo founder** handling development, sales, and customer success. This constraint drives ruthless prioritization and self-serve product design.

### User Research & Validation Approach

**Current Foundation:** This PRD is informed by competitive analysis (Notisum market validation, €40M ARR at poor UX), founder domain expertise in the Swedish SMB market, and analysis of existing legal compliance pain points.

**MVP Validation Strategy:** The MVP serves as the primary user research vehicle. Key assumptions to validate post-launch:

- **Assumption 1:** SMB owners will pay €399-899/month for compliance automation (validate via trial-to-paid conversion >25%)
- **Assumption 2:** AI-powered guidance reduces need for legal consultants (validate via user interviews at Month 3)
- **Assumption 3:** Change monitoring drives retention (validate via churn rate <5% monthly)
- **Assumption 4:** SEO-driven freemium model acquires customers cost-effectively (validate via CAC:LTV ratio)

**Post-MVP Research Plan:** Conduct structured user interviews (n=20-30) at Month 3 to validate feature prioritization and identify gaps in current offering. Use NPS surveys and usage analytics to guide Phase 2 roadmap.
