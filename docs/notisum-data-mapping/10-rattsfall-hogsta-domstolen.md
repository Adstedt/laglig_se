## What is Högsta Domstolen (HD)?

**Högsta Domstolen** is Sweden's highest general court of appeal for civil and criminal cases.

**Role:**
- Final court of appeal in civil and criminal matters
- Ensures uniform application of law
- Creates binding precedent (prejudikat)
- Only hears cases of legal significance (leave to appeal required)

**Different from:**
- **Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen** (Supreme Administrative Court) - administrative law cases
- **EU-domstolen** (CJEU) - EU law interpretation
- **Hovrätter** (Courts of Appeal) - intermediate appellate courts

## Publication in NJA

**NJA = Nytt Juridiskt Arkiv I**

**What it is:**
- Official case reporter for Supreme Court decisions
- Published by **Domstolsverket** (Swedish Courts Administration)
- Contains selected, precedent-setting cases
- Not all HD decisions are published in NJA - only those of legal significance

**Numbering format:**
- **Pattern:** `NJA YYYY s NN` or `NJA YYYY Not N NN`
- **YYYY** = Year
- **s** = sida (page number in NJA volume)
- **NN** = Sequential number or page number
- **Not** = Notis (brief notice/summary case, less significant)

**Examples from screenshot:**
- `NJA 2025 s 3` - Case #3 from 2025 (full published decision)
- `NJA 2025 s 13` - Case #13 from 2025
- `NJA 2025 Not N 3` - Brief notice #3 from 2025

- **Previous NJA cases** - Links to other HD cases

**❌ Dead/broken links (user observation):**
- **Most proposition links** - Link structure exists but many don't work

**Cross-reference structure:**
- Cases cite laws (SFS)
- Cases cite other cases (NJA precedents)
- Cases cite propositioner for legislative intent
- Cases cite SOU for background

---

## Data Source

**Primary sources (per Notisum):**
- **Domstolsverket** (Swedish Courts Administration) - provides case summaries/referats
- **Högsta Domstolen** (Supreme Court itself) - provides full judgment texts

**Publication timeline:**
1. HD issues judgment
2. Appears first as "Notis" (notice/summary) in Notisum
3. Later published in official NJA volume by Domstolsverket
4. Full text added to Notisum

**Data format:**
- Full text of judgments
- Structured metadata
- ✅ Notisum HOSTS the full content (not external links)

---

## Data Volume Estimate

**Coverage:** 1981-2025 (44 years)

**Cases per year:** Variable, but relatively low volume
- HD only hears cases of legal significance
- Leave to appeal required (prövningstillstånd)
- Estimate: 50-150 published NJA cases per year
- Many more "Not" (notices) - brief summaries of less significant cases

**Total estimate:** 3,000-5,000+ full NJA cases in Notisum database

**Note:** This is only published/reported cases. HD decides many more cases that aren't published in NJA.

## Why Supreme Court Cases Matter

**Legal precedent:**
1. **Binding authority** - Lower courts must follow HD interpretations
2. **Gap-filling** - HD resolves ambiguities in statutes
3. **Evolution of law** - Shows how legal principles develop over time
4. **Practical guidance** - Real-world application of abstract legal rules

**For businesses:**
- **Contract law** - How courts interpret commercial agreements
- **Tort law** - Liability standards
- **Property law** - Real estate and property rights
- **Criminal law** - Corporate criminal liability

**Example use case:**
- Company faces employment lawsuit
- Lawyer researches: "Has HD ruled on similar situations?"
- Finds NJA 2018 s. 456 with similar facts
- Uses HD's reasoning to advise client or argue case

## Relevance for Laglig.se

**High value for legal professionals:**
1. **Lawyers** - Essential for case research and argumentation
2. **In-house counsel** - Understanding legal risks and compliance
3. **Judges/legal clerks** - Researching precedent
4. **Law students** - Studying Swedish legal doctrine

**Moderate-to-low value for SMB compliance:**
- Most SMBs need "what is the law" (SFS) not "how has it been interpreted"
- Exception: Businesses in litigation or complex compliance situations
- Case law is dense and requires legal expertise to interpret

**Recommendation for Laglig.se:**

**MVP (Phase 1):**
- ⚠️ **Maybe include basic access** - Allow viewing cases but no advanced features
- **Lower priority than SFS** - Binding law comes first

**Phase 2 (Professional tier):**
- ✅ **Full case law database** - HD + other courts
- **Key features:**
  - Search by legal issue, year, keywords
  - **Link from SFS laws to relevant cases** - "This section has been interpreted in 15 HD cases"
  - **AI summaries** - "This case held that X applies when Y circumstances"

**Phase 3 (Enterprise/Legal tier):**
- **Advanced citator** - Track which cases have cited this case
- **Negative treatment** - Flag overruled or distinguished precedents
- **Practice area filtering** - Employment law, contract law, etc.
- **Timeline visualization** - See evolution of legal doctrine

## Data Volume Across All Courts

**Högsta Domstolen** is just one court. Notisum also has cases from:
- **Hovrätterna** (Courts of Appeal) - Much higher volume
- **Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen** - Administrative law
- **Arbetsdomstolen** - Labor law
- **Patent- och marknadsdomstolen** - IP and competition law
- **Mark- och miljööverdomstolen** - Environmental law
- **Migrationsöverdomstolen** - Immigration law

- **Justitiekanslern** - Chancellor of Justice decisions

**Total case law:** Likely 50,000-100,000+ cases across all courts and years

## Key Differences from EU Court Case Law

| Feature | Swedish HD | EU Court (CJEU) |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Jurisdiction** | Swedish national law | EU law |
| **Binding on** | Swedish courts | All EU member state courts |
| **Publication** | NJA (Nytt Juridiskt Arkiv) | EUR-Lex |
| **Numbering** | NJA YYYY s NN | C-NNN/YY (CELEX 6...) |
| **Data source** | Domstolsverket + HD | EUR-Lex |
| **Hosted by Notisum** | ✅ Yes - full text | ✅ Yes - full text |
| **Language** | Swedish | All EU languages (including Swedish) |
| **Coverage in Notisum** | 1981-present | 1954-present |

## Technical Integration Notes

**Data availability:**
- ✅ Domstolsverket likely has API or data feed (needs verification)
- ✅ Notisum hosts full text - suggests they have access to source data
- HD publishes judgments publicly on domstol.se

**Potential APIs:**
- Check if Domstolsverket offers structured data access
- HD may have its own data feeds

**Linking opportunities:**
1. **SFS → HD cases** - "This law section has been interpreted in these cases"
2. **Case → Case** - Citation network (which cases cite which)
3. **Proposition → Cases** - "This legislative intent was interpreted in these cases"
4. **Subject matter classification** - Group cases by legal area

## Research Questions

- [ ] Does Domstolsverket provide API access to NJA cases?
- [ ] Are all hyperlinks in case text present in source data or added by Notisum?
- [ ] Why do many proposition links not work? Are they never created or have they broken?
- [ ] Can we obtain NJA case metadata in structured format?
- [ ] Are there subject matter codes/classifications for cases?
- [ ] How quickly are new HD judgments added to Notisum after publication?

## Summary

**Högsta Domstolen case law (NJA) is:**
- ✅ **Hosted by Notisum** - Full text available
- ✅ **Critical for legal research** - Binding precedent
- ✅ **Well-structured** - Chronological access, searchable
- ⚠️ **Some broken links** - Proposition references often don't work
- ⚠️ **Moderate SMB value** - Useful for compliance but requires legal expertise

**For Laglig.se:**
