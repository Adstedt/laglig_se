## Numbering Format

**Pattern:** `JKB [number]-[year]-[number]`

**Breakdown:**

- `JKB` = Justitiekanslern Beslut (JK Decision)
- `[number]` = Case number
- `-[year]` = Year (2 digits)
- `-[number]` = Additional identifier

**Examples from screenshot:**

- `JKB 835-13-22`
- `JKB 3535-13-21`
- `JKB 699-14-31`
- `JKB 4182-12-22`
- `JKB 1441-14-47`
- `JKB 3391-14-30 3696-14-30` (multiple case numbers)
- `JKB 4243-13-40 m.fl.` (m.fl. = med flera = with others)

**Note:** Complex numbering system, some cases have multiple numbers

---

## URL Pattern

**Format:** `https://www.notisum.se/rn/document/?id=JKB[number]`

**Example from screenshot:**

- `JKB 835-13-22` → `id=JKB60935`

**Note:** URL ID doesn't directly match case number (similar to JO)

---

## Individual Case Page Structure

"Initiativärende med anledning av påtalade brister i Centrala etikprövningsnämndens verksamhet"

Translation: "Initiative matter regarding identified deficiencies in the Central Ethical Review Board's operations"

### Limited Content

**From screenshot:**

- Shows "Visa dokument" (Show document) button
- Shows "- - -" which suggests limited or no content
- User reports: "External links are dead 90%"

## What JK Does vs. Courts

**Important distinctions:**

| Feature                 | JK Decisions                       | Court Decisions          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Institution type**    | Government legal advisor/ombudsman | Judicial court           |
| **Legal force**         | Limited (opinions/recommendations) | Binding precedent        |
| **Can represent state** | Yes (in damage claims)             | N/A                      |
| **Can prosecute**       | Yes (press freedom violations)     | N/A                      |
| **Binding precedent**   | No                                 | Yes                      |
| **Legal opinions**      | Yes (government advisor)           | No (courts decide cases) |

**JK can:**

- ✅ Provide legal opinions to government
- ✅ Represent state in damage claims
- ✅ Prosecute press freedom violations
- ✅ Investigate complaints (like JO)
- ✅ Award damages (in state liability cases)

**JK cannot:**

- ❌ Create binding legal precedent
- ❌ Overturn court decisions
- ❌ Enforce its opinions on government

## Data Volume and Quality

**Coverage:** 1998-2014 (16 years)

- **Last data:** 2014
- **Data age:** 11 years old (as of 2025)
- **Status:** Database appears abandoned

**Volume from screenshot (2013):**
Multiple cases shown, suggesting moderate volume per year.

**Data quality issues:**

1. **Outdated** - No updates since 2014
2. **Broken links** - 90% of external links don't work (user observation)
3. **Limited content** - Individual pages show "- - -"
4. **Similar to JO issue** - Metadata available but content broken

---

## Why JK Decisions Matter (or Don't)

**Very limited relevance for businesses:**

1. **Not binding precedent** - Legal opinions and decisions, not binding law
2. **Government focus** - Advisor to government, not business regulator
3. **Outdated database** - No data after 2014
4. **Data quality issues** - Broken links, limited content

**Some potential value:**

- State damage claims (if business has claim against government)
- Freedom of press matters (if media business)
- Understanding government legal interpretations (historical)

**Very low priority compared to:**

- **Courts (HD, HFD, AD, etc.)** - Binding legal precedent
- **Laws (SFS)** - Actual legal requirements
- **Current ombudsman decisions** - Would need from jk.se for post-2014

---

## Relevance for Laglig.se

**Very low value for SMBs:**

1. **Not binding precedent** - Opinions and decisions, not binding law
2. **Government focus** - Not directly applicable to business operations
3. **Outdated** - Database ends in 2014, 11 years ago
4. **Data quality issues** - Broken links, limited content
5. **Better alternatives** - Court cases, current laws

**Recommendation for Laglig.se:**

**MVP (Phase 1):**

- ❌ **Skip entirely** - Very low business relevance, outdated, broken
- **Focus instead:** AD, HFD, HD, HovR (binding precedent)

**Phase 2 (Professional tier):**

- ❌ **Still skip** - Outdated data (ends 2014), limited value
- **Complete courts first** - All current court databases before historical JK

**Phase 3 (Enterprise/Specialized tier):**

- ❌ **Skip** - Even for specialized use, would need current data from jk.se
- **If needed:** Obtain from jk.se directly (NOT Notisum)
- **Very low priority** - After all courts, laws, regulations, and current ombudsman decisions

---

## Data Availability Issues

**Current status in Notisum:**

- ✅ Landing page with categories exists
- ✅ Chronological register with case summaries (through 2014)
- ❌ **Database ends in 2014** - No updates for 11 years
- ❌ Limited content on individual case pages
- ❌ 90% of links broken (user observation)

**Why database might be abandoned:**

1. JK may have stopped publishing to Notisum after 2014
2. Database migration issues
3. Licensing or partnership ended
4. JK now publishes only on jk.se

**Alternative source:**

- **jk.se** - Official JK website
  - Current decisions and opinions
  - Damage claim decisions
  - Legal opinions
  - Free public access
  - Would be better source than outdated Notisum data

## Summary

**Justitiekanslern decisions (JK) in Notisum:**

- ❌ **Outdated** - Database ends in 2014 (11 years old)
- ❌ **Broken links** - 90% of external links don't work
- ⚠️ **Limited content** - Summaries exist but full text appears incomplete
- ⚠️ **Not a court** - Government legal advisor/ombudsman, not binding precedent
- ❌ **Not binding** - Legal opinions and recommendations, not binding law
- 📊 **Very low business relevance** - Government advisor, not business regulator

**For Laglig.se:**

- **Very low priority** - Outdated, not binding, limited business relevance
- **Data quality issues** - Ends 2014, broken links, limited content
- **Skip for MVP, Phase 2, and Phase 3** - Focus on courts and laws
- **If ever needed** - Use jk.se for current data, not Notisum

**Key insight:** JK decisions in Notisum are **NOT VIABLE** because:

1. **Outdated** - Database abandoned after 2014
2. **Not binding legal precedent** - Only opinions and recommendations
3. **Government focus** - Not applicable to most businesses
4. **Data quality issues** - Broken links, limited content
5. **Better alternatives exist** - Court decisions, current laws, jk.se for current JK decisions

**Recommendation:** Do NOT include JK from Notisum in Laglig.se. Database is too outdated and broken to provide value.

**Priority ranking for Laglig.se (updated):**

1. **Essential:** SFS laws, AD, HFD, HD (binding law and precedent)
2. **High:** HovR, MÖD, EU law (important precedent and compliance)
3. **Moderate:** Propositioner, MIG (specialized needs)
4. **Low:** SOU, Ds (preparatory works, limited direct application)
5. **Very low:** JO (not binding, data issues), **JK (not binding, OUTDATED, broken)**

**Final verdict on JK:** Skip entirely - outdated database (2014), broken links, not binding precedent, very low business relevance.
