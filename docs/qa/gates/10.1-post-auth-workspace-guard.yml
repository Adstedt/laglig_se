  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Auth checks present in all routes. Onboarding layout verifies session. Workspace guard catches errors correctly. No hardcoded secrets.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Middleware scoped with matcher after QA fix. Workspace context cached via React.cache(). Onboarding layout DB queries acceptable for low-traffic page.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Typed WorkspaceAccessError with explicit codes. Proper error propagation for UNAUTHORIZED/ACCESS_DENIED. PAUSED state handled in-shell with banner.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Helper function extraction improves readability. PausedWorkspaceBanner properly separated as client component. Brand styling matches auth layout exactly.'
