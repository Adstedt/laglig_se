    status: PASS
    notes: 'No user input, Prisma parameterized queries, safe preference defaults'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'N+1 pattern acceptable for daily cron with small recipient counts. Recipient resolution uses efficient single query with select.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Batch processing isolates errors per ChangeEvent. Idempotency guard prevents duplicates. Structured logging with context.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation (resolution vs service), barrel exports, comprehensive JSDoc, well-structured tests'
