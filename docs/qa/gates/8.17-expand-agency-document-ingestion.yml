    notes: 'No auth/authorization changes. Read-only web fetching with proper User-Agent. SHA-256 hashing only. No secrets committed.'

    notes: 'Idempotent operations throughout: hash-unchanged skip on backfill, upsert pattern for DB writes. Error handling on all fetch/API calls.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns. Registry file is large (2580+ lines) but type-safe. Test descriptions have stale counts (advisory only — assertions are correct).'
