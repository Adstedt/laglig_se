status_reason: 'All critical issues resolved. DRY stub filter helpers now used across all 5 filter locations, getBasePath covers AGENCY_REGULATION, test checkboxes accurately reflect coverage. Migration concern accepted by team (db push is the standard approach for this project).'

top_issues:

    finding: 'Idempotency and page render tests deferred (require DB mock and component test setup respectively). Parsing, filter, and content-type utility tests provide good baseline coverage.'
    suggested_action: 'Add these tests when component test infrastructure is available or during a testing-focused sprint.'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No auth/payment code touched. dangerouslySetInnerHTML matches existing pattern. Stub pages show metadata only.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Sequential upserts acceptable for 51 records. Filters use indexed columns. No new heavy queries.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Idempotent upsert pattern correct. force-dynamic prevents stale cache.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Stub filter logic now centralized in document-filters.ts helper and used by all consumers.'
