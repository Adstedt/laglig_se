  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All routes auth via getWorkspaceContext(). Ownership check on mark-as-read. No raw SQL. No XSS vectors.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: '5-min polling interval, max 5 notifications per request, queries use existing indexes. N+1 enrichment acceptable at N=5.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful error handling in all routes and client. Silent failure in client is appropriate for non-critical notification feature. Optimistic updates self-correct on next fetch.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean component separation (bell + item). Consistent API route pattern. Good TypeScript types. 34 tests provide confidence for future changes.'
