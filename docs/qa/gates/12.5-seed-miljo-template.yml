gate: PASS
status_reason: 'All 7 ACs fully implemented and tested. 88 unit tests passing (exceeds 50+ target). Clean TypeScript strict-mode compilation. Faithful adaptation of the 12.4 reference pattern with appropriate Miljö-specific extensions (10 regulatory bodies, 14 EU CELEX conversions, no AFS complexity). Cross-list overlap data verified via CSV cross-referencing.'

    notes: 'Data-seeding script with no external input surfaces. Prisma parameterized queries only.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'One-time seed operation. 98 sequential upserts is appropriate. Test suite runs in 110ms.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful missing-document handling (skip + log). Idempotent via upsert. Denormalized count auto-correction. Dry-run mode for safe preview.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Follows 12.4 pattern exactly. Pure functions exported for testability. Self-contained script (Option A). Clear separation of parsing, classification, and DB operations.'
