story_title: 'Refactor Task List View for UX Parity with Law List'
gate: PASS
status_reason: >
  All 40 acceptance criteria met (AC 36 workspace-keyed persistence follows
  established app-wide static-key pattern). 33 new tests pass, 60 law list
  regression tests unaffected. Shared component extraction is clean and
  well-architected. Two minor cleanup items noted as future recommendations.
