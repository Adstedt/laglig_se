  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No user input handling. Prisma parameterized queries. Content type guard prevents unintended processing.'

    status: PASS
    notes: 'Batch operations via $transaction. HNSW index well-tuned (m=16, ef_construction=64) for <1M vectors. O(1) token estimation.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Atomic transaction for chunk lifecycle. Graceful handling of missing documents, empty content, and excluded content types.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation: token-count (pure), chunk-document (pure transform), sync-document-chunks (DB orchestration). Barrel exports. Well-documented strategy in architecture docs.'
