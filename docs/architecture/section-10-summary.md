✅ **Developer Experience:** Type-safe, component-driven development
✅ **User Experience:** Progressive enhancement, optimistic updates, real-time features

2. **Hybrid State Management:** URL state, Context, and Zustand for different needs
3. **Explicit Caching:** "use cache" directive for precise control
4. **Component Organization:** Feature-based structure for scalability
5. **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it
