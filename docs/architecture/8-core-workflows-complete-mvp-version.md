# 8. Core Workflows (Complete MVP Version)

## 8.1 Workflow Overview

This section documents ALL critical user journeys required for MVP through sequence diagrams. Workflows are organized by priority tier to ensure implementation focus.

**MVP Priority Tiers:**

- **P0 (Blocking):** Must have for basic functionality
- **P1 (Critical):** Required for MVP launch
- **P2 (Important):** Enhances MVP but can be simplified
- **P3 (Post-MVP):** Document now, implement later
