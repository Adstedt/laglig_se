# Project Brief: Laglig.se

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-01-27
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

**Laglig.se** is an AI-powered legal compliance platform that makes Swedish business law accessible and actionable for companies of all sizes. Unlike traditional legal databases that simply provide access to laws, Laglig.se transforms compliance from a reactive burden into proactive business infrastructure through personalized law lists, AI-powered guidance, and automated monitoring of regulatory changes.

The platform targets Swedish SMBs (5-200 employees) who currently face two poor choices: expensive legal consultants or DIY compliance with outdated tools like Notisum. By combining comprehensive legal data (all SFS laws, court cases, EU regulations) with modern AI assistance and intuitive UX, Laglig.se positions compliance as "coolt med koll" - aspirational rather than obligatory.

**Key value proposition:** Make the law free and public (SEO-indexed), then monetize AI-powered compliance tools, personalized workflows, and industry-specific guidance that save businesses from costly legal mistakes.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**

Swedish businesses are legally obligated to comply with hundreds of laws spanning arbetsmiljö (workplace safety), arbetstträtt (employment law), avtalsrätt (contract law), miljörätt (environmental law), and sector-specific regulations. For most SMBs, compliance is:

1. **Reactive rather than proactive** - Companies only address compliance when facing audits, employee complaints, or regulatory violations
2. **Expensive when done right** - Legal consultants charge 1,500-3,000 SEK/hour, making routine compliance guidance prohibitively expensive
3. **Risky when done wrong** - A single HR mistake (improper termination, arbetsmiljö violation) can cost 100,000-500,000+ SEK in fines and settlements
4. **Difficult to navigate** - Existing tools (Notisum, InfoTorg Juridik) have outdated UX, no AI assistance, and require legal expertise to interpret

**Impact & Cost:**

- **Notisum generates ~40M SEK ARR at 60% margins** despite inferior product - validates strong market demand and healthy unit economics
- **SMBs overpay for basic legal advice** - paying hourly consultant fees for questions that could be answered by RAG-powered AI with proper guardrails to prevent hallucinations
- **Costly mistakes are common** - Arbetsmiljöverket fines, wrongful termination settlements, contract disputes
- **Compliance anxiety is universal** - Business owners don't know what they don't know, creating constant legal risk

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

1. **Notisum** - Dated UX (looks like 1990s software), no AI assistance, just static document access, expensive (8,000+ SEK/year)
2. **Legal consultants** - Expensive, slow, reactive (you pay per question rather than having ongoing guidance)
3. **DIY/Google** - Unreliable, fragmented, no personalization, high risk of misinterpretation
4. **Enterprise tools** (Visma, SAP) - Overkill for SMBs, expensive, require dedicated compliance staff

**Urgency:**

- **AI maturity** - RAG + LLM technology now enables zero-hallucination legal guidance (wasn't viable 2-3 years ago)
- **Regulatory volatility** - Increasing EU regulations + Swedish law changes create recurring compliance updates businesses struggle to track
- **Market timing** - Notisum's dominance despite poor UX shows market is ripe for disruption
- **SMB digitalization** - Post-COVID, SMBs increasingly adopt SaaS tools (Fortnox, Visma, etc.) - compliance is logical next step

---

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:**

Laglig.se transforms legal compliance from a reactive burden into proactive business infrastructure by combining three elements:

1. **Free, SEO-indexed legal content** - All Swedish laws (SFS), court cases (HD, HFD, AD, etc.), EU regulations publicly accessible and Google-indexed
2. **AI-powered compliance tools** (paid) - RAG-based chatbot, personalized law lists, automated task generation, change monitoring, kanban-workflows, collaborative work
3. **Industry-specific guidance** (paid) - Tailored compliance packs for construction, restaurants, tech, manufacturing, etc.

**How It Works:**

**For Discovery (Free - SEO Engine):**

- Business owner Googles "arbetsmiljölagen anställd" → lands on Laglig.se law page (ranked #1)
- Reads law for free in modern, clean UX
- Sees "Want AI to explain this for your business? Try Laglig.se tools"

**For Conversion (Paid - Onboarding Magic):**

- Dynamic onboarding flow asks questions while building company profile
- User provides: org-number, URL, industry, employee count
- AI generates personalized law list in real-time (streaming preview), with contextual commenting generated by AI (just comments, not interpretations)
- Shows tailored workspace with Kanban-style compliance tracking
- Call-to-action: "Start 14-day free trial to access full compliance tools"

**For Retention (Paid - Ongoing Value):**

- **AI Chatbot:** "Can I fire this employee for poor performance?" → RAG-powered answer citing specific laws + court cases
- **Change Monitoring:** New arbetsmiljölagen amendment → automated notification + new compliance task
- **Task Management:** Kanban board tracking compliance status (compliant, needs action, overdue)
- **Industry Packs:** Construction module with building permits, safety requirements, contractor agreements
- **Team Collaboration:** HR manager uses daily, CFO reviews quarterly, both on same account

**Key Differentiators:**

1. **Freemium SEO Moat** - Public content ranks for everything, drives organic traffic, impossible for competitors to replicate overnight
2. **RAG-Powered AI** - Zero-hallucination through comprehensive Swedish law database (SFS + court cases + EU regulations)
3. **Proactive, Not Reactive** - Monitors legal changes and pushes tasks BEFORE deadlines/violations
4. **"Coolt med koll" Positioning** - Compliance as aspirational ("cool to be compliant") not burdensome
5. **Personalization** - Every user sees THEIR specific laws and compliance needs, not generic guidance
6. **Modern UX** - Jira-inspired Kanban, conversational AI, streaming onboarding vs. Notisum's 1990s interface

**Why This Succeeds Where Others Haven't:**

- **Notisum** charges for content access; Laglig.se gives content free, charges for tools (unbundling/rebundling strategy)
- **Consultants** are reactive and expensive; Laglig.se is proactive and subscription-based
- **Enterprise tools** require compliance staff; Laglig.se replaces the need for dedicated staff via AI
- **DIY/Google** lacks reliability; Laglig.se provides source-cited AI answers with legal backing

**High-Level Product Vision:**

Transform Laglig.se into essential business infrastructure (like Fortnox for accounting) where Swedish businesses can't imagine operating without it - not because they're forced to comply, but because it makes compliance effortless and prevents costly mistakes. It's sort of like an insurance with a negligable cost.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: SMB Owner / HR Manager (5-50 employees)

**Demographics:**

- Small-to-medium businesses in Sweden

- Industries: Tech, restaurants, retail, services, small manufacturing
- Typically one person wearing "HR hat" (owner, office manager, or part-time HR)

**Current Behaviors:**

- Googles legal questions when issues arise ("kan jag säga upp anställd")
- Asks business network for advice
- Occasionally pays lawyer 2,000-3,000 SEK/hour for simple questions
- Uses spreadsheets or no system for tracking compliance
- Reactive: addresses compliance only when facing problem (employee complaint, audit, fine)

**Pain Points:**

- **Fear of unknown costs:** "What legal obligation am I missing that could cost me 500,000 SEK?"
- **Time drain:** Researching laws takes hours away from running business
- **Uncertainty:** "Is this interpretation correct? Am I following the law?"
- **HR questions constant:** Probation periods, parental leave, termination procedures, vacation rules

**Goals:**

- Avoid costly legal mistakes (fines, wrongful termination suits)
- Quick, reliable answers to HR/compliance questions
- Confidence they're "doing it right"
- Minimal time investment ("set it and forget it")

**Value Proposition:**

- Automated alerts prevent compliance lapses

**Willingness to Pay:** 399-1,499 SEK/month (ROI: One avoided mistake pays for years of subscription)

- **Audit intensity:** Frequent audits from multiple oversight bodies (Riksrevisionen, county administrative boards)
- **Budget constraints:** Limited budgets despite extensive compliance needs
- **Public scrutiny:** Mistakes are publicly visible and politically sensitive

- **Market size:** 290 kommuner + 21 regioner + 50+ statliga bolag = ~360 organizations
- **ARR potential at 50% penetration:** ~13M SEK from public sector alone

**Strategic Value:**

- Fast sales cycles (weeks not months) due to direktupphandling pricing

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Budget:**

- Bootstrap/self-funded development (solo founder/small team)
- Limited budget for initial AI API costs (OpenAI/Anthropic) - need to optimize token usage
- Cannot afford large upfront infrastructure costs - leveraging serverless (Vercel) and generous low-cost tiers
- Fortnox partnership critical for growth without significant CAC spend

**Timeline:**

- **18-month target to 10M SEK ARR** (aggressive but achievable with focused execution)
- MVP needs to launch within 4-6 months to start revenue generation
- Change monitoring must be in MVP (retention engine) - no room for Phase 2 delay
- Public sector sales cycles can be 1-3 months even with direktupphandling advantage

**Resources:**

- Solo founder/developer initially (full-stack + AI expertise required)
- Time split between development, sales, and customer success
- Limited capacity for manual customer onboarding - product must be self-serve where possible, one person dedicated to public sector sales/onboarding.
- Need to leverage AI code assistants and no-code tools where appropriate

**Technical:**

- **Database performance with 10,000+ SSR pages** - Need efficient caching/CDN strategy
- **Vercel Edge functions timeout limits** (30s max) - Complex AI operations may need queue
- **Real-time WebSocket limits on Vercel** - May need separate service for change monitoring
- **Vector database costs** - Pinecone pricing scales with storage/queries (alternative: pgvector)
- **AI API rate limits** - Need fallback strategies and graceful degradation
- **Legal content accuracy** - Zero hallucination tolerance requires robust RAG guardrails, ensure model only replies with facts and avoids answering if unable.
- **Swedish language models** - May need model fine-tuning or prompt engineering for legal Swedish

### Key Assumptions

**Technical Assumptions:**

1. **Semantic chunking for RAG will significantly outperform fixed token size** for Swedish legal documents (needs validation but highly likely based on legal document structure)

2. **Vercel AI SDK component streaming is production-ready** for complex workflows (drag-and-drop components, contextual streaming)

3. **Can build comprehensive RAG vector database for 10,000+ Swedish legal documents** with acceptable query performance (<2s response time)

4. **PostgreSQL with pgvector can handle vector similarity search - supabase?** at scale without needing separate Pinecone subscription (cost optimization assumption)

5. **Next.js App Router SSR can handle 10,000+ dynamically rendered law pages** with acceptable SEO indexing rates and Core Web Vitals

6. **OpenAI or Anthropic models have sufficient Swedish legal language understanding** without fine-tuning (may need prompt engineering)

**Business Assumptions:**

7. **Public sector will adopt at 4,000 SEK/month pricing point** (under direktupphandling threshold of ~100k SEK) without lengthy tender processes

8. **Fortnox partnership achievable with 75/25 revenue share** (favorable to us) - Fortnox sees value in offering compliance to their 400k+ SMB customers

9. **Network effects in public sector** - First few kommun customers will drive word-of-mouth to neighboring municipalities/regions

10. **Freemium SEO model will drive significant organic B2B traffic** - Companies searching for laws will discover gated tools and convert

11. **Change monitoring as retention engine is valid** - Users will see sufficient legal changes monthly to justify continued subscription

12. **SMB segment willing to pay 1,000 SEK/month** (vs. Notisum's higher tiers) for AI-powered tools vs. static legal database

**Product Assumptions:**

13. **Multi-user/team features won't significantly increase MVP development complexity** - Core auth + role management is straightforward with NextAuth

14. **HR module is "easy add" with existing schema** - Database structure designed (Fortnox Copy), needs frontend implementation (~1-2 weeks work)

15. **ISO compliance managers have budget authority** for 4,000 SEK/month tools without lengthy procurement

16. **"Coolt med koll" brand positioning resonates** with Swedish SMB culture (anti-boring, practical, confident)

17. **Drag-and-drop component-based chat UX is learnable** - Users will understand "drop law card into chat" interaction pattern

**Market Assumptions:**

18. **Notisum's 40M SEK ARR at 60% margins** indicates healthy market willingness to pay for legal information

19. **Notisum's weaknesses are real** - AD database issues, JK outdated data, lack of AI features represent genuine competitive opportunities

20. **AI-powered compliance is category-creating** - Not just "better legal database" but new category of proactive compliance tools

21. **Public sector has 600+ organizations** reachable in 18 months through targeted outreach + word-of-mouth

22. **Fortnox customer base of 400k+ includes 500+ potential Laglig.se customers** in year one willing to pay 500 SEK/month add-on

### Critical Assumptions Requiring Early Validation

🔴 **Highest Risk Assumptions (Validate in First 3 Months):**

1. **Public sector procurement speed under direktupphandling** - Interview 3-5 kommun buyers
2. **Fortnox partnership feasibility** - Outreach to Fortnox partnership team in Q1
3. **RAG semantic chunking performance** - Technical validation sprint (week 2-3 of development)
4. **SMB willingness to pay 1,000 SEK/month** - Landing page + pricing validation interviews
5. **Change monitoring frequency creates retention** - Analyze historical SFS change data (monthly change rate)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

**1. Market Risk: Notisum Responds with AI Features**

- **Description:** Notisum (40M SEK ARR, established brand) adds AI chatbot and compliance tools before our MVP launch
- **Impact:** HIGH - Removes our primary differentiation, makes customer acquisition significantly harder
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - They have resources but may be slow to innovate (legacy codebase, organizational inertia)
- **Mitigation:** Speed to market is critical (4-6 month MVP), establish "AI-first" positioning early, focus on superior UX (component streaming, drag-and-drop) that's harder to copy

**2. Technical Risk: RAG Hallucination in Legal Context**

- **Description:** AI generates incorrect legal advice despite RAG guardrails, leading to customer harm and liability
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Could destroy business reputation, potential legal liability, loss of trust
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Legal language is complex, Swedish legal AI less tested than English
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict RAG-only responses (no generative content without source)
  - Citation for every claim with SFS reference
  - Human review of AI-generated compliance checklists before launch
  - Clear disclaimers ("AI-assisted, not legal advice")
  - Consider legal liability insurance

**3. Technical Risk: Swedish Language Model Performance**

- **Description:** OpenAI/Anthropic models struggle with Swedish legal terminology, producing poor quality responses
- **Impact:** HIGH - Product quality suffers, customer satisfaction low, high churn
- **Likelihood:** LOW-MEDIUM - Models handle Swedish but legal domain is specialized
- **Mitigation:**
  - Early technical validation (week 2-3) with real Swedish legal queries
  - Prompt engineering with legal context
  - Consider fine-tuning if base models insufficient
  - Fallback to keyword search if AI confidence low

**4. Go-to-Market Risk: Public Sector Sales Cycle Longer Than Expected**

- **Description:** Even with direktupphandling pricing, public sector takes 6-12 months to buy (not 1-3 months)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Cash flow delayed, may need to pivot to SMB-first strategy
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Procurement processes vary by organization size/sophistication
- **Mitigation:**
  - Early validation interviews with kommun buyers (month 1-2)
  - Start with smaller kommuner (faster decision-making)
  - Focus on SMB segment first for faster revenue
  - Public sector becomes Phase 2 if sales cycle too long

**5. Partnership Risk: Fortnox Partnership Doesn't Materialize**

- **Description:** Fortnox declines partnership or wants unfavorable terms (50/50 split, or wants 50% revenue share to them)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Loses 500 customers (2.25M SEK ARR) from plan, need alternative distribution
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Partnership teams are risk-averse, integration effort required
- **Mitigation:**
  - Outreach to Fortnox in Q1 to gauge interest early
  - Alternative partnerships: Visma, PE Accounting, Björn Lundén
  - Build standalone SMB acquisition machine (SEO + content marketing)
  - Fortnox is "nice to have" not "must have" - SMB + public sector can reach 10M ARR alone

**6. Product Risk: Change Monitoring Doesn't Drive Retention**

- **Description:** Legal changes are too infrequent or irrelevant, users don't see value in notifications
- **Impact:** HIGH - Primary retention engine fails, churn increases to 8-10%/month (vs. target 3-4%)
- **Likelihood:** LOW - SFS changes regularly, but may need broader definition (EU law, court cases, regulatory updates)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Analyze historical SFS change frequency (first month)
  - Expand monitoring beyond SFS: EU law, major court cases (HD/HFD), regulatory guidance
  - Add "industry news" digests even if not formal law changes
  - Proactive compliance task suggestions trigger retention too

**7. Competitive Risk: Incumbent Locks Up Public Sector with Long-Term Contracts**

- **Description:** Notisum or Karnov signs 3-5 year contracts with target public sector customers before our launch
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Reduces addressable public sector market, delays revenue
- **Likelihood:** LOW - Public sector generally does annual renewals, hard to lock long-term
- **Mitigation:**
  - Even with contracts, can still demo and get on "next year" list
  - Focus on kommuner/regioner not currently using paid legal tools
  - Offer migration incentives (free first 3 months)

**8. Execution Risk: Solo Founder Bandwidth**

- **Description:** Development + sales + customer success too much for one person, progress slows or quality suffers
- **Impact:** HIGH - MVP delays, customer success suffers, founder burnout
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Common solo founder challenge
- **Mitigation:**
  - Ruthless MVP scope focus (must-haves only)
  - Leverage AI tools for development speed (Claude Code, Cursor, v0.dev)
  - Self-serve product design (minimize manual onboarding)
  - Consider contractor for specific tasks (frontend polish, content creation)
  - Set hard boundaries on feature creep

**9. Financial Risk: AI API Costs Scale Faster Than Revenue**

- **Description:** Vector database queries + AI chat costs exceed gross margins, unit economics break
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Business model doesn't work, need to raise prices or reduce AI usage
- **Likelihood:** LOW-MEDIUM - Vector search + LLM calls can get expensive at scale
- **Mitigation:**
  - Track unit economics from day 1 (cost per active user)
  - Implement aggressive caching (75%+ cache hit rate target)
  - Rate limiting per user tier (10 AI queries/day for 1k tier, unlimited for 4k tier)
  - Consider usage-based pricing for heavy users
  - Optimize RAG retrieval (fewer embeddings queries per chat)

**10. Data Risk: Legal Content Scraping/Parsing Errors**

- **Description:** Automated scraping of Riksdagen data introduces errors, missing content, or outdated information
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Product quality issues, trust erosion
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Riksdagen data quality varies, APIs may change
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build validation pipeline (checksums, content comparison against source)
  - Manual spot-checks of high-traffic laws (10-20 most viewed)
  - User reporting mechanism for errors
  - Regular re-scraping (weekly) to catch updates

### Open Questions

**Product & UX:**

1. **What's the optimal AI chat context window?** How many messages of history do we maintain? Does drag-and-drop component context count against token limits?

Similar to standard chatGPT workflows (history in-chat and other historical chats you can revisit)

2. **How do we handle multi-law interactions?** User asks "which law applies to remote work AND GDPR?" - do we create composite view or separate cards?

We provide a contextual summary, but we always work with individual cards as these cards are the backbone of all our different tools/workflows.

3. **What's the onboarding flow for non-technical users?** Do we need video tutorials? Interactive product tour? Or is "coolt med koll" personality + clean UX enough?

We can add tutorial mode at a later stage after we validate MVP.

4. **How granular should change monitoring be?** Entire law changed vs. specific paragraph? Do users want every small amendment or only "material changes"?

Every time there is an official amendment we need to inform of what it is.

5. **Should HR module include payroll integration?** Or stay focused on compliance (employment contracts, work environment, etc.)?

We obvioulsy include pay-levels, but manage nothing tied to payroll. We just need the data inside the employee object to query our chatbot.

**Technical:**

6. **PostgreSQL pgvector vs. Pinecone - what's the tipping point?** At what scale (queries/day, vector count) does Pinecone become worth the cost?

Will evaluate after MVP.

7. **How do we handle real-time change detection?** Polling Riksdagen daily? Webhook if available? What's the SLA for "law changed → user notified"?

We'll use riksdagens API, there is best practice for this inside the official documentation.

8. **What's the semantic chunking strategy exactly?** Split by paragraph? By section? Hybrid approach? Need to test multiple strategies.

9. **Do we need separate vector embeddings for SFS vs. court cases vs. EU law?** Or one unified vector database?

10. **How do we version control legal content?** Git-based? Database snapshots? Important for "show me what changed" feature.

**Business & GTM:**

11. **What's the ideal first customer profile?** 10-person SMB with in-house admin? 50-person company with HR manager? ISO consultant?

12. **Should we offer annual upfront payment discount?** (e.g., 10 months for 12) to improve cash flow?

Yes, we can offer a 15% discount for annual signups simiar to many SAAS.

13. **What's the competitor response timeline?** How fast can Notisum ship AI features if they decide to?

Years.

14. **Are there regulatory compliance requirements for AI legal tools in Sweden?** GDPR obvious, but any specific legal tech regulations?

Not as far as we know.

15. **What's the churn benchmark for B2B SaaS in Sweden?** Is 3-4% monthly churn realistic or optimistic?

Unknown, will evaluate.

**Partnerships:**

16. **Beyond Fortnox, what's the priority order for partnerships?** Visma > PE Accounting > Björn Lundén? Or different GTM channel entirely (accountant network)?

We can partner with ISO-certification organs and offer revenue-share

17. **Should we have affiliate program for accountants/consultants?** 20% recurring commission for referrals?

Yes, at 10-15% recurring revenue. We will evaluate.

18. **Do we need integration with Google Workspace / Microsoft 365 for adoption?** Or is standalone web app sufficient?

Standalone for now, will work on integrations in the future (teams, slack etc)

### Areas Needing Further Research

**Market Research:**

- **Swedish legal tech funding landscape** - Are there grants (Vinnova, EU) for legal tech innovation? Nordic VCs interested in legal tech?
- **Public sector budget cycles** - When do kommuner/regioner plan annual software budgets? Q4 for next year?
- **ISO consultant market sizing** - How many active ISO consultants in Sweden? What tools do they currently use?
- **Churn analysis of Notisum** - Can we find former customers? Why did they leave? (Product Hunt, Trustpilot, Reco)

**Technical Research:**

- **Swedish legal AI benchmarks** - Are there existing datasets for evaluating Swedish legal question answering?
- **Riksdagen API reliability** - Uptime stats? Rate limits? Change notification mechanisms?

## Appendix: Research Summary

### Competitive Analysis Summary

**Notisum** (Primary competitor)

- 40M SEK ARR, 60% margins, established 20+ years
- Strengths: Comprehensive legal database, brand recognition, court case coverage
- Weaknesses: No AI features, poor AD database quality, outdated JK data (ends 2014), static content
- Opportunity: AI-powered compliance tools, superior UX, change monitoring

**Karnov Group** (Nordic leader)

- Larger but more expensive, targets law firms and large enterprises
- Less relevant for SMB segment

**International comparables:**

- Casetext (acquired by Thomson Reuters for $650M) - AI legal research
- Harvey AI ($100M+ funding) - Legal AI for law firms
- Rocket Lawyer - Consumer + SMB legal tools

### Key Insights from Notisum Documentation

From 18 detailed data mapping documents:

- **Strong databases:** HD, HFD, HovR, MÖD, MIG (full case law)
- **Broken databases:** AD (employment - critical gap!), JO (limited content), JK (outdated 2014)
- **Missing AI layer:** Static search only, no contextual understanding
- **No proactive tools:** No change monitoring, no personalized compliance checklists

**Strategic implication:** Laglig.se can win by focusing on AI-powered proactive compliance (not just better legal search).
